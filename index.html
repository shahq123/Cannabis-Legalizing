Cannabis, hemp, buds, and Devil’s lettuce are some of the words used for
marijuana.At most, many countries and cities allow legalized cannabis for
medicinal use, while some countries allow it for recreational use. However,
the decision in America is left to our local state governments. The legalization
of cannabis has been a subject of ongoing debate in politics, but for lawmakers,
it is significant. Therefore, if a bill were to go through Congress right now,
national legalization most likely would not pass. Since alcohol and tobacco laws
in the US are generally legalized on a national level, cannabis should also be
nationally legalized because it is much safer than alcohol and tobacco, offers
multiple health benefits, and generates economic growth.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The use of alcohol and tobacco can lead to significant health risks. There is
simply no doubt that drinking alcohol in America is an American tradition. This
does not necessarily mean it is good. Smoking tobacco dates back to the time
when the United States colonized North America, and the Native Americans
introduced tobacco. Despite the historical context and importance of American
culture, alcohol and cigarettes causes far worse dangers than individual
cannabis use. Alcohol is a depressant, yet its effects depend on how much one
drinks.<em> WebMD</em>, an American corporation known primarily online for news
and information pertaining to human health and well-being, writes about alcohol
in the article, “How Alcohol Affects Your Body.” The article explains that
“Alcohol races into your brain. It slows down the chemicals and pathways that
your brain cells use to send messages. That alters your mood, slows your
reflexes, and throws off your balance.” Alcohol impairs the equilibrium of
people and their eyesight, and it adversely affects the attitudes
of drinkers by making them much less competent in their actions (WebMD).</P>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Like alcohol, smoking has negative effects like alcohol. When a person smokes
	a cigarette for the first time, the chemicals start to build up in the lungs
	and become life-threatening. In the article "What's In a Cigarette?"
	The American Lung Association, a voluntary health organization whose mission
	is to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease through
	education, advocacy, and research, claims that “cigarettes create more than
	7,000 chemicals. At least 69 of these chemicals are known to cause cancer,
	and many are toxic.” By destroying the cells that line the lungs, smoking
	triggers lung cancer. Changes in lung tissue begin almost instantly when a
	person inhales cigarette smoke which is full of cancer-causing substances
	known as carcinogens. The body can heal some of the initial damage;
	however, normal cells that line the lungs are progressively weakened with
	each repeated chemical exposure. Over time, the damage causes cells to
	behave abnormally, and cancer may develop eventually (Association). Alcohol
	and tobacco have serious health consequences.</p>

 <p>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 In contrast, cannabis has been shown to have far less health risk than
	 alcohol and tobacco. An experiment was conducted to determine which suggest
	 substance, alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis substance have the highest and
	 lowest risk. Dirk W. Lachenmeier, a food chemist and toxicologist and Jürgen
	 Rehm, a senior scientist, write about these substances in the article,
	 “Comparative Risk Assessment of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and other
	 illicit drugs using the margin of exposure approach.” They claim that
	 “The toxicological MOE approach validates epidemiological and social
	 science-based drug ranking approaches especially in regard to the positions
	 of alcohol and tobacco (high risk) and cannabis (low risk).”  For certain
	 types of cancer, especially those of the mouth and throat, people who
	 drink and smoke are at higher risk.Around eighty percent of mouth and
	 throat cancer cases in men and about sixty-five percent in women are caused
	 by alcohol and tobacco. The risk of mouth and throat cancer rises
	 significantly for people who both smoke and drink. In fact, the combined
	 risk is greater than or equal to the risk associated with alcohol compounded
	 by the risk associated with tobacco. Co-use of alcohol and tobacco appears
	 to significantly increase the risk of at least one form of cancer. As such,
	 no connection exists to link marijuana with cancer. However, the use of
	 marijuana has an effect on the developing brain. This fact speaks for
	 itself, especially as no one has died due to cannabis exposure
	 (Lachenmeier & Rehm, p. 1). Alcohol and tobacco elevates more the risk than
	 marijuana, and this argument needs to be taken into account when it comes to
	 national legalization.</p>

 <p>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Also, Smoking cannabis can provide numerous health benefits, even on a very
	 small scale. Cannabis smokers also undergo beneficial physical reactions
	 from smoking cannabis, and they are effective most of the time. Cannabis
	 results include a better overall feeling, cramp suppression, reduced anxiety
	 and depression, and suppression of cancer cells. A report by The National
	 Academies of Sciences, the collective scientific national academy of the
	 United States,provides data from a study by multiple health and
	 social science scientists that found “the most common conditions for which
	 medical cannabis is used in Colorado and Oregon are pain, spasticity
	 associated with multiple sclerosis, nausea, posttraumatic stress disorder,
	 cancer, epilepsy, cachexia, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, and degenerative neurological
	 conditions." The active chemicals in medical marijuana are comparable to
	 chemicals that are involved in appetite, memory, motion, and pain created
	 by the body. It mixes with the other chemicals to help reduce pain or address
	 any other medical conditions without harming the body because the same
	 chemical is found in cannabis (Sciences). The report also stated that
	 “In adults with chronic pain,patients who were treated with cannabis or
	 cannabinoids are more likely to experience a clinically significant reduction
	 in pain symptoms.” While a variety of health conditions and symptoms can be
	 treated with medical cannabis, it is most commonly prescribed to alleviate
	 chronic pain. Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabidiol both offer effective pain
	 relief and can be a better option than traditional medicine These positive
	 effects are very necessary, and doctors want to use them for all patients
	 with these diseases, as long as medicinal cannabis use is legal in all states
	 (Sciences).</P>

 <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition to aiding patients, legal cannabis has produces economic effects
that are beneficial to the sellers and the state. Leafly cannabis web store
report from Professional Services Close-Up, writes about drugs in the article,
“Leafly Report: Legal Cannabis Industry Now Supports 321,000 Full-Time American
Jobs” reported that “California remains the nation's leader in cannabis jobs,
with 57,970 full-time equivalent jobs and more than $3.77 billion in cannabis
sales in 2020.” Marked by the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 2020, in California,
the cannabis industry was a bright spot of development and potential.
Cannabis-related enterprises, which were declared critical businesses by the
state early in the pandemic, not only created 57,970 new full-time equivalent
jobs but also drove a record-high $3.8 billion in cannabis retail revenues in
2020, a 20 percent raise over 2019 (Close-Up). As the figures reveal, the
economic advantages of legal cannabis are very real. It is then possible to
use the money for the states for a vast majority of development improvements;
ranging from building the economy to feeding the homeless.</P>

	Those who oppose the national legalization of Cannabis present. Many people
	object for moral reason. Others are against cannabis because they realize the
	risks of smoking. As a significant result, opponents often point to a rise in
	road crash fatalities. Wayne Hall, Inauguralprofessor and director of the
	Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research and Michael Lynskey, a New Zealand
	academic and psychiatrist describes about car crashes in the article,
	“Evaluating the public health impacts of legalizing recreational cannabis use
	in the United States.” They point out that, “found a larger increase in
	cannabis positive fatalities in Colorado after 2009 than in the 34 states
	without MMLs.” It explained that young males substituting cannabis for alcohol
	because cannabis was cheaper in MML states caused an increase in car crashes
	(Hall & Lynskey, p. 1767).</p>
<P>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	On the one hand, there are those who agree with Wayne Hall and Michael
	Lynskey that cannabis can cause car accidents. But on the other hand, they
	still insist that cannabis does not increase car accidents. Richard
	P. Compton, a director of the Office of Behavioral Safety Research at the
	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Department of
	Transportation, and Amy Barning, a research psychologist with the National
	Highway Traffic Safety Administration cite Eduardo Romano, Senior Scientist
	at Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, article “Drug and Alcohol
	Crash Risk” when they write “study found no increased risk of crash
	involvementfor those drivers testing positive for THC (the main psychoactive
	substance in marijuana).” The accident involved, drug-positive drivers and
	drug-negative drivers. They are known to have been at fault for their
	collisions.Case-control drivers have differed greatly in an impartial manner
	for the drivers involved in the collision. More closely monitored research
	actually measure the usage of marijuana (Tetrahydrocannabinol) rather than
	relying on self-reporting, and had more effective control of covariates result
	in bias.The findings typically indicate reduced risk estimates or no risk
	associated with marijuana use (Compton & Berning, p. 1).It is basically a
	strategy the <strong> bunking </strong> anybody's marijuana is a dangerous argument. </P>

	Cannabis should be legalized nationwide because it is much safer than alcohol
 and tobacco provides numerous health benefits and stimulates economic growth.
 Unlike drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes, the facts show that cannabis
 can give people who use it so many advantages and it does not even affect the
 health of those who choose not to use it. For people battling with and
 suffering from chronic illnesses, the medical effects of marijuana can be so
 beneficial, offering them hope and relief. To those people who hardworking
 and the motivated, legalizing cannabis would create the opportunity to live
 better life. The cannabis industry raises a substantial 20 percent in a year.
 To opponents of legalizing cannabis use, marijuana does not cause car
 accidents.Although many people object for moral reasons to try to prove that
 it’s bad using science, their arguments are fairly easy to prove wrong. In
 the future legalizing cannabis can help those who don’t have a job by giving
 them a job, and treat many serious medical conditions like cramp suppression,
 reduced anxiety and depression, and suppression of cancer cells.</p>
